#[10_156(0,0), K10n32(0,0)]
So the slope might be characteristic.

The exteriors of all other knots Kn' have greater volume than the exterior of K.

Therefore, the knot 10_156 has at most one integral characteristic slope: ['-2']
----------------------------------------
Knot 10_159

The length of the (n,1)-framing of K is greater than or equal to 0.407 times |n| and greater than 12.498 .

Thus, for all integers n such that |n| >  30  n is not a characterizing slope for this knot: the exterior of Kn' certainly has greater volume than the exterior of K. Let's check for the other 61 integral slopes.

The exterior of K has volume 11.7406410379 

Z.dehn_fill((2,1),0) yields volume 11.740641038 

Snappy identifies this knot as:
#[10_159(0,0), K10n34(0,0)]
So the slope might be characteristic.

The exteriors of all other knots Kn' have greater volume than the exterior of K.

Therefore, the knot 10_159 has at most one integral characteristic slope: ['2']
----------------------------------------
Knot 10_164

The length of the (n,1)-framing of K is greater than or equal to 0.418 times |n| and greater than 12.639 .

Thus, for all integers n such that |n| >  30  n is not a characterizing slope for this knot: the exterior of Kn' certainly has greater volume than the exterior of K. Let's check for the other 61 integral slopes.

The exterior of K has volume 12.506687931 

Z.dehn_fill((-2,1),0) yields volume 12.5066879309 

Snappy identifies this knot as:
#[10_165(0,0), K10n38(0,0)]
So the slope might be characteristic.

The exteriors of all other knots Kn' have greater volume than the exterior of K.

Therefore, the knot 10_164 has at most one integral characteristic slope: ['-2']

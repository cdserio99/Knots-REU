\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\kh{[Introduction with some motivation and introduction of terms like ``characterizing slopes''. See the papers by Yi and Zhang and by McCoy and by Lackenby on characterizing slopes for ideas to steal. Mention Piccirillo's results for unknotting number one and using this to show that the Conway knot isn't slice. Mention that McCoy's work \cite{mccoy:hyperbolic}, which shows that a hyperbolic knot has only finitely many non-characterizing slopes $p/q$ with $|q| \geq 3$. In a sense, this implies that ``most'' slopes $p/q$ are characterizing for any given hyperbolic knot $K$: The  probability that a randomly chosen slope $p/q$ is characterizing approaches 1 as $|p|+|q|\to \infty$.]}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:unknotting-one} If a knot $K$ has unknotting number one and is not a twisted Whitehead double, then $K$ has at most finitely many integer characterizing slopes.
\end{theorem}

We worked our way towards Theorem ~\ref{thm:unknotting-one} by manually finding knots $K_{n}'$ with equal $n-$ surgery as an unknotting number $u(K)=1$ knot $K$. Beginning with this process, we found the following result for knots with low crossing number:

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:low-crossing} For knots $K$ with crossing number $c(K) \leq 10$:
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont \bf (\alph*)]
		\item If $K$ has unknotting number $u(K)=1$ and $K$ is not a twist knot, then $K$ has at most one integer characterizing slope, namely $\pm 2$.
		\item If $K$ is one of the knots $8_4$, $8_6$, $8_{10}$, or $8_{12}$, then $K$ has $u(K)>1$ and has no integer characterizing slopes.
		\item If $K$ is the twist knot $8_1$, then $K$ has at most one integer characterizing slope, namely $0$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

This theorem specifies the number of integer characterizing slopes for several knots with $c(K) \leq 10$. It is possible that the bound on $c(K)$ can be increased, especially for knots with unknotting number $u(K) = 1$. Similarly, the list in part (b) can probably be expanded, encompassing every knot that fits Piccirilo's construction. Part (c) of this theorem also suggests that the assumption in Theorem ~\ref{thm:unknotting-one} that $K$ is not a Twisted Whitehead Double might not be necessary. But it was proven \kh{by Ozsváth and Szabó 2006, maybe cite}  that every slope is characterizing for $K$ the trefoil and the figure-eight knots, so we should expect part (c) to possibly hold only for twist knots with $n$ twists where $n$ is sufficiently large.

Theorem~\ref{thm:low-crossing} affirmatively answers a question proposed in Baker and Motegi:

\begin{question}
	Are there any knots of crossing number less than 8 that have infinitely many noncharacterizing slopes? \cite[Question~1.7]{baker-motegi}
\end{question}

\begin{corollary}
	All knots of crossing number less than 8 with unknotting number $u(K) = 1$ which are not twist knots have infinitely many noncharacterizing slopes.
\end{corollary}

The proof of this theorem relies in part on a computer program to calculate volumes of finitely many surgeries on each knot. We use the software SnapPy, which can triangulate hyperbolic manifolds. The script used is included on \kh{maybe put on Appendix?}, and the files produced for all knots encompassed can be found on \kh{Kyle's website}.

\subsection{Surgery duals} Let $Y$ be a 3-manifold given by $p/q$-surgery on a knot $K\subset S^3$. Then $Y$ is obtained by thickening $K$ to a solid torus $N(K)$, removing the interior of $N(K)$ from $S^3$, and gluing a solid torus back into $S^3\setminus\mathrm{int}(N(K))$ in a different manner. Note that $K$ is the core of the solid torus $N(K)$, i.e., $K$ is identified with $S^1\times\{0\}$ under the diffeomorphism between $N(K)$ and $S^1\times D^2$. The core of the new solid torus that is glued into $S^3\setminus\mathrm{int}(N(K))$ specifies a knot $\gamma$ in $Y$, which we call the \textit{surgery dual} of $K$. In a surgery diagram for $Y$, $\gamma$ can be represented by a meridian to $K$. If $K'\subset S^3$ is another knot which yields the same $p/q$-surgery as $K$, then one can ask how the surgery dual $\gamma'$ of $K'$ in $Y$ is related to $\gamma$. 

\begin{conjecture}[Baker] If $K$ and $K'$ are non-isotopic knots in $S^3$ which yield the same $3$-manifold $Y$ under $p/q$-surgery, then their surgery duals $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ in $Y$ are not homotopic.
\end{conjecture}

We showed that Baker's conjecture holds for all knots $K$ with unknotting number $u(K) = 1$ and crossing number $c(K) \leq 10$ in the case of zero surgery. The files corresponding to this verification can be found on \kh{Kyle's website}.

\section{Knots with unknotting number one}\label{sec:unknotting-one}


\subsection{Banded Hopf link diagrams} \kh{[Describe these and how they produce diagrams that fit into Piccirillo's construction. Give examples for a couple knots with unknotting number one, plus an example for a knot with unknotting number two.]}

\subsection{Piccirillo's construction} We have the following theorem due to Piccirillo:

\begin{theorem}[Piccirillo, 2018]
	Let $L$ be a three-component link consisting of disjoint components $R$, $B$, and $G$, giving a surgery diagram such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $R$ is a 0-framed unknot,
		\item $B$ and $G$ have integral framings,
		\item If we remove $G$ (resp. $B$), then $R$ is isotopic to a meridian to $B$ (resp. $G$).
	\end{enumerate}
	Let $Y$ be the 3-manifold given by surgery on $L$. Then for any $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, there are knots $K,K'\subset S^3$ such that $Y\cong S_n^3(K)\cong S_n^3(K')$.

\end{theorem}

If $K$ is a knot with $u(K)=1$, then for any integer $n$, this construction yields another knot $K_n'$ (not necessarily distinct from $K$) with the same $n$-surgery as $K$. To see this, we begin with a banded Hopf link diagram for $K$. We then take a Hopf link with components $R$ and $B$, both with framings 0, and we handle slide $B$ over $R$ according to the band presentation for $K$. This produces a two-component link, with $B$ becoming $K$ and $R$ becoming a 0-framed unknot $c$ linked with $K$. We adjust the framing of $B$ to $n$. If we add a meridian $G$ to $R$ and slide $B$ back over $R$, then we obtain a diagram fitting into Picirillo's construction.

To obtain the knot $K_n'$, we begin with the two component link $B\cup R$ described above, where $B$ is $K$ with framing $n$ and $R$ is a 0-framed unknot. We add a 0-framed meridian $G$ to $K$, and we note that if $B$ has nonzero framing, then by a slam dunk, we can change the framing of $B$ to 0 if we add a meridian $P$ to $B$ with framing $-1/n$. We slide $B$ over $R$, and we isotope the diagram until $B$ and $R$ are both unknots which cross each other twice, i.e., $B$ and $R$ form a Hopf link if $G$ is removed. We then slide $G$ over $B$ until $G$ is no longer linked with $R$. At this stage, we can remove $R$ using a ``lightbulb trick." This leaves us with a two-component link $G\cup P$. The component $G$ is the knot $K_0'$ with the same 0-surgery as $K$, and $P$ is an unknot $c'$ linked with $K_0'$. We now obtain $K_n'$ by doing a Rolfson twist on $G$ along $P$, which is isotopic to twisting $K_0'$ along $c'$ $n$ times.


\subsection{Twist families of knots}

Let K be an unoriented smooth knot in the oriented 3-sphere $S^3$ and $V$ a solid torus with a preferred framing that contains K in its interior. Define an orientation-preserving homeomorphism $f_n$ of $V$ s.t. $f_n(m)=m$ and  $f_n(l)=l+nm$ in $H_1(\partial V)$ where $(m, l)$ is a preferred meridian-longitude pair of $V$. Call $f_n$ a twisting homeomorphism, which defines the new knot $f_n(K)$ in $S^3$ and thus a twisting operation on K. Write $K_{V,n} := f_n(K)$.

From a two-component link $K\cup C$ where $C$ is an unknot linked with $K$, we can get the new knot $K_n := K_{V,n}$ where $K_{V,n}$ is with respect to C as the preferred meridian of a solid torus V containing K in its interior (i.e. we obtain $K_n$ from $K\cup C$ by twisting n times along C for K in int(V) for V a solid torus with meridian C). A twist family of knots, $K_A$, is $\{K_n | n \in A\}$ with $A$ some index set.  Note that for all $m, n$ in $A$,  $K_m$ is obtained from $K_n$ by a ($m-n$)-twist of $V$ by \cite[Remark 2.2]{twisting-knot-types}. Hence $K_n'$ that we obtained from Piccirillo's construction forms a twist family for integral $n$ since it is isotopic to twisting $K_0'$ along $c'$ $n$ times. 

To appeal to \cite[Theorem 3.2]{twisting-knot-types}, we adapt it as follows. 

\begin{theorem}[Kouno, Morel and Shibuya] For a two-component link $K\cup C$, if $C$ is neither disjoint from $K$ nor a meridian of $K$, then there are at most finitely many integers $n$ such that $K_{V,n}\simeq K$. 
\end{theorem}

Since Piccirillo's construction clearly leaves $c'$ linked with $K_0'$, it remains to show that $c'$ is not a meridian of $K_0'$ to get at the finiteness of integral $n$ such that $K_n' = K_{V,n}\simeq K$ (ie K has at most finitely many integer characterizing slopes). 


\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:unknotting-one}} We want to show that under the hypotheses on $K$, $K_n'\simeq K$ for at most finitely many $n$. If $K_n'\not\simeq K$ for all $n$, then $K$ has no integer characterizing slopes. If $K_N'\simeq K$ for some $N$, then we note that $K_n'$ is obtained by twisting $K$ through the unknot $c$, $n-N$ times. Moreover, $c$ is not a meridian to $K_N'$ if and only if it is not a meridian to $K_0'$. To see this, note that if $c$ is a meridian to $K_0'$, then twisting through $c$ does not change $K_0'$; hence $K_0'\simeq K_N'$, and $c$ is not a meridian to $K_N'$. The converse follows by interchanging $K_0'$ and $K_N'$. It remains to show that $c'$ is not a meridian to $K_0'$, for then the result of Kouno, Motegi, and Shibuya \cite[Theorem 3.2]{twisting-knot-types} described in 2.3 applies to the twist family $\{K_n'\}$ to show that $K_n'\simeq K_N'\simeq K$ for at most finitely many $n$. 

Recall from 2.1 that since $K$ is not a twisted Whitehead double, in any band presentation for $K$, the band must cross one component of the Hopf link. The following lemma then proves that in the link $K\cup c$ appearing in Piccirillo's construction, the unknot $c$ is not a meridian to $K$.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $R\cup B$ be a Hopf link, and consider a handle slide of $R$ over $B$ which leaves $R$ a meridian to $B$. Then there is an equivalent handle slide of $R$ over $B$ along a band which does not cross either $R$ or $B$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	TBD
\end{proof}

We now appeal to a lemma of Baker and Motegi \cite[Lemma 2.4]{baker-motegi}, with notation adapted:

\begin{lemma}[Baker-Motegi, 2018]
	Let $K_0'\cup c'$ be a two-component link in $S^3$ such that $c'$ is a meridian of $K_0'$. Then $(0,0)$-surgery on $K_0'\cup c'$ results in $S^3$ with its surgery dual link $c\cup K$, for which $c$ is a meridian to $K$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
	If $c$ is not a meridian to $K$, then $c'$ is not a meridian to $K_0'$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	We know that $c'$ and $K_0'$ are surgery duals to $K$ and $c$ respectively. Show that it follows that $c$ and $K$ are dual to $K_0'$ and $c'$ respectively.
\end{proof}
This completes the proof of the theorem.

\section{Knots with low crossing number}

\subsection{Possible extensions of Theorem 1.1} \kh{[Note that $u(K)=1$ is not necessary for Piccirillo's construction. We only need to be able to produce a link $R\cup B$ (with $B\simeq K$ and $R$ an unknot) from handle slides on a Hopf link. Explain this procedure for knots with $u(K)>1$.]}

\subsection{Hyperbolic Dehn surgery} \kh{[Recall and discuss the relevant theorems used in our approach.]}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:low-crossing}}

To prove Theorem~\ref{thm:low-crossing}, we need to rule out infinitely many characterizing slopes for each of the knots $K$ we are interested in. In general, this is a two-part algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item We use the theorems of hyperbolic Dehn surgery to find a bound $N \in \zz_{>0}$ such that any slope $n \in \zz$ is not characterizing if $|n|>N$.
	\item For the $2 N + 1$ remaining cases, we directly examine a knot $K_{n}'$ with the same $n$-surgery as $K$. If $K_{n}' \neq K$, we know that $n$ is noncharacterizing.
\end{enumerate}

\kh{[First part, based on hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorems. Explain how we found N.]}

This is a tedious computational problem. It was convenient for us to let a computer program run this proof. The algorithm executes the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item From the DT code of a link 
	$L = K \cup B \cup c$ fitting the description \kh{above}, the program writes the file "[INFO]K.py" asking for the volume ... [\kh{depends on above}].
	\item SnapPy opens, runs, and saves this file, producing a first output file named "[OUT][INFO]K.py".
	\item  The program extracts this information and calculates the bound $N$ described above.
	\item The program writes the file "[TEST]K.py" asking for the volume of the knot with the same $n$-surgery than  $K$ for all $n$ such that $|n| \leq N$.
	\item SnapPy opens, runs, and saves this file, producing a second output file named "[OUT][TEST]K.py".
	\item If the user asked for it, the program verifies if this last file contains all $2 N + 1$ cases. Because the run time in SnapPy is sometimes unpredictable, this step is recommended although the proof may be faster without it.
	\item The program identifies the manifolds whose volume is less than or equal (up to approximations) the exterior of the knot $K$. Those cases are singled out in the output file.
\end{enumerate}

All files corresponding to the knots listed in Theorem ~\ref{thm:low-crossing} can be found on \kh{Kyle's website}. These files prove the theorem

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont \bf (\alph*)]
		\item For all knots $K$ of crossing number at most 10 with unknotting number $u(K) = 1$ and not twist knots, the program indicates that only $n = 2$ or $n = -2$ could be characterizing.
		\kh{\item For $K$ one of the knots $8_4$, $8_6$, $8_{10}$, or $8_{12}$, the program indicates that all knots $K_{n}'$ have different volume than $K$, so no integral slopes can be characterizing.
			\item For the knot $8_1$, the program indicates that only $n = 0$ could be characterizing.}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\kh{[I have not written much of the math behind it (like defining the manifold Z, dehniflling the one-hlde in X, etc) because I want to see the notation Anton uses for the previous part.]}
